# RocketLeague-Trade-Sheet
This is a Python script that uses openpyxl, a Python and Excel module.
It helps you keep track of trades and arrange them better.


Run the main.py and add a trade:
![rl_trades](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45268315/111537338-fbc65500-8773-11eb-8999-a5d19c26acf2.png)

the trade will be saved in the .xlsx sheet that is there.
All trades are color labled and saved for better organizing:
